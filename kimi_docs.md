# Main Concepts

## Text Generation Model [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#text-generation-model)

Moonshot's text generation model (referred to as moonshot-v1) is trained to understand both natural and written language. It can generate text output based on the input provided. The input to the model is also known as a "prompt." We generally recommend that you provide clear instructions and some examples to enable the model to complete the intended task. Designing a prompt is essentially learning how to "train" the model. The moonshot-v1 model can be used for a variety of tasks, including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, and creative writing.

## Language Model Inference Service [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#language-model-inference-service)

The language model inference service is an API service based on the pre-trained models developed and trained by us (Moonshot AI). In terms of design, we primarily offer a Chat Completions interface externally, which can be used to generate text. However, it does not support access to external resources such as the internet or databases, nor does it support the execution of any code.

## Token [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#token)

Text generation models process text in units called Tokens. A Token represents a common sequence of characters. For example, a single English character like "antidisestablishmentarianism" might be broken down into a combination of several Tokens, while a short and common phrase like "word" might be represented by a single Token. Generally speaking, for a typical English text, 1 Token is roughly equivalent to 3-4 English characters.

It is important to note that for our text model, the total length of Input and Output cannot exceed the model's maximum context length.

## Rate Limits [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#rate-limits)

How do these rate limits work?

Rate limits are measured in four ways: concurrency, RPM (requests per minute), TPM (Tokens per minute), and TPD (Tokens per day). The rate limit can be reached in any of these categories, depending on which one is hit first. For example, you might send 20 requests to ChatCompletions, each with only 100 Tokens, and you would hit the limit (if your RPM limit is 20), even if you haven't reached 200k Tokens in those 20 requests (assuming your TPM limit is 200k).

For the gateway, for convenience, we calculate rate limits based on the max\_tokens parameter in the request. This means that if your request includes the max\_tokens parameter, we will use this parameter to calculate the rate limit. If your request does not include the max\_tokens parameter, we will use the default max\_tokens parameter to calculate the rate limit. After you make a request, we will determine whether you have reached the rate limit based on the number of Tokens in your request plus the number of max\_tokens in your parameter, regardless of the actual number of Tokens generated.

In the billing process, we calculate the cost based on the number of Tokens in your request plus the actual number of Tokens generated.

### Other Important Notes: [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#other-important-notes)

- Rate limits are enforced at the user level, not the key level.
- Currently, we share rate limits across all models.

## Model List [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#model-list)

You can use our [List Models API](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat#list-models) to get a list of currently available models.

# Usage Guide

## Getting an API Key [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#getting-an-api-key)

You need an API key to use our service. You can create an [API key](https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/api-keys) in our [Console](https://platform.moonshot.ai/console).

## Sending Requests [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#sending-requests)

You can use our Chat Completions API to send requests. You need to provide an API key and a model name. You can choose to use the default max\_tokens parameter or customize the max\_tokens parameter. You can refer to the [API documentation](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api-reference#python-usage) for the calling method.

## Handling Responses [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/introduction\#handling-responses)

Generally, we set a 2 hours timeout. If a single request exceeds this time, we will return a 504 error. If your request exceeds the rate limit, we will return a 429 error. If your request is successful, we will return a response in JSON format.

If you need to quickly process some tasks, you can use the non-streaming mode of our Chat Completions API. In this mode, we will return all the generated text in one request. If you need more control, you can use the streaming mode. In this mode, we will return an [SSE (opens in a new tab)](https://kimi.moonshot.cn/share/cr7boh3dqn37a5q9tds0) stream, where you can obtain the generated text. This can provide a better user experience, and you can also interrupt the request at any time without wasting resources.

Chat

# Basic Information

## Public Service Address [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#public-service-address)

```
https://api.moonshot.ai
```

Moonshot offers API services based on HTTP, and for most APIs, we are compatible with the OpenAI SDK.

# Quickstart

## Single-turn chat [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#single-turn-chat)

The official OpenAI SDK supports [Python (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and [Node.js (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/openai/openai-node). Below are examples of how to interact with the API using OpenAI SDK and Curl:

pythoncurlnode.js

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
    messages = [\
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Kimi, an AI assistant provided by Moonshot AI. You are proficient in Chinese and English conversations. You provide users with safe, helpful, and accurate answers. You will reject any questions involving terrorism, racism, or explicit content. Moonshot AI is a proper noun and should not be translated."},\
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, my name is Li Lei. What is 1+1?"}\
    ],
    temperature = 0.6,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Replace `$MOONSHOT_API_KEY` with the API Key you created on the platform.

When running the code in the documentation using the OpenAI SDK, ensure that your Python version is at least 3.7.1, your Node.js version is at least 18, and your OpenAI SDK version is no lower than 1.0.0.

```
pip install --upgrade 'openai>=1.0'
```

> You can easily check the version of your library like this:
>
> ```
> python -c 'import openai; print("version =",openai.__version__)'
> # The output might be version = 1.10.0, indicating that the current python is using the v1.10.0 library of openai
> ```

## Multi-turn chat [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#multi-turn-chat)

In the single-turn chat example above, the language model takes a list of user messages as input and returns the generated response as output.
Sometimes, we can also use the model's output as part of the input to achieve multi-turn chat. Below is a simple example of implementing multi-turn chat:

pythonnode.js

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

history = [\
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Kimi, an AI assistant provided by Moonshot AI. You are proficient in Chinese and English conversations. You provide users with safe, helpful, and accurate answers. You will reject any questions involving terrorism, racism, or explicit content. Moonshot AI is a proper noun and should not be translated."}\
]

def chat(query, history):
    history.append({
        "role": "user",
        "content": query
    })
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
        messages=history,
        temperature=0.6,
    )
    result = completion.choices[0].message.content
    history.append({
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": result
    })
    return result

print(chat("What is the rotation period of the Earth?", history))
print(chat("What about the Moon?", history))
```

It is worth noting that as the chat progresses, the number of tokens the model needs to process will increase linearly. When necessary, some optimization strategies should be employed, such as retaining only the most recent few rounds of chat.

#### Request body [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#request-body)

| Field | Required | Description | Type | Values |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| messages | required | A list of messages that have been exchanged in the conversation so far | List\[Dict\] | This is a list of structured elements, each similar to: `{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}` The role can only be one of `system`, `user`, `assistant`, and the content must not be empty. See [Content Field Description](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat#content-field-description) for detailed information about the content field formats |
| model | required | Model ID, which can be obtained through List Models | string | Currently one of `kimi-k2.5`,`kimi-k2-0905-preview`, `kimi-k2-0711-preview`, `kimi-k2-turbo-preview`, `kimi-k2-thinking-turbo`, `kimi-k2-thinking`, `moonshot-v1-8k`,`moonshot-v1-32k`,`moonshot-v1-128k`, `moonshot-v1-auto`,`moonshot-v1-8k-vision-preview`,`moonshot-v1-32k-vision-preview`,`moonshot-v1-128k-vision-preview` |
| max\_tokens | optional | The maximum number of tokens to generate for the chat completion. If the result reaches the maximum number of tokens without ending, the finish reason will be "length"; otherwise, it will be "stop" | int | It is recommended to provide a reasonable value as needed. If not provided, we will use a good default integer like 1024. **Note:** This `max_tokens` refers to the length of the tokens you expect us to **return**, not the total length of input plus output. For example, for a `moonshot-v1-8k` model, the maximum total length of input plus output is 8192. When the total length of the input messages is 4096, you can set this to a maximum of 4096; otherwise, our service will return an invalid input parameter (invalid\_request\_error) and refuse to respond. If you want to know the "exact number of input tokens," you can use the "Token Calculation" API below to get the count using our calculator |
| temperature | optional | The sampling temperature to use, ranging from 0 to 1. A higher value (e.g., 0.7) will make the output more random, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) will make it more focused and deterministic | float | Default is 0.0 for `moonshot-v1` series models, 0.6 for `kimi-k2` models and 1.0 for `kimi-k2-thinking` models. This parameter cannot be modified for the `kimi-k2.5` model. |
| top\_p | optional | Another sampling method, where the model considers the results of tokens with a cumulative probability mass of top\_p. Thus, 0.1 means only considering the top 10% of tokens by probability mass. Generally, we suggest changing either this or the temperature, but not both at the same time | float | Default is 1.0 for `moonshot-v1` series and `kimi-k2` models, 0.95 for `kimi-k2.5` model. This parameter cannot be modified for the `k2.5` model. |
| n | optional | The number of results to generate for each input message | int | Default is 1 for `moonshot-v1` series and `kimi-k2` models, and it must not exceed 5. Specifically, when the temperature is very close to 0, we can only return one result. If n is set and > 1 in this case, our service will return an invalid input parameter (invalid\_request\_error). Default is 1 for `kimi-k2.5` model and it cannot be modified. |
| presence\_penalty | optional | Presence penalty, a number between -2.0 and 2.0. A positive value will penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text, increasing the likelihood of the model discussing new topics | float | Default is 0. This parameter cannot be modified for the `kimi-k2.5` model. |
| frequency\_penalty | optional | Frequency penalty, a number between -2.0 and 2.0. A positive value will penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text, reducing the likelihood of the model repeating the same phrases verbatim | float | Default is 0. This parameter cannot be modified for the `kimi-k2.5` model. |
| response\_format | optional | Setting this to `{"type": "json_object"}` enables JSON mode, ensuring that the generated information is valid JSON. When you set response\_format to `{"type": "json_object"}`, **you must explicitly guide the model to output JSON-formatted content in the prompt and specify the exact format of the JSON, otherwise it may result in unexpected outcomes**. | object | Default is `{"type": "text"}` |
| stop | optional | Stop words, which will halt the output when a full match is found. The matched words themselves will not be output. A maximum of 5 strings is allowed, and each string must not exceed 32 bytes | String, List\[String\] | Default is null |
| thinking | optional | Only available for `kimi-k2.5` model. This parameter controls if the thinking is enabled for this request | object | Default to be `{"type": "enabled"}`. Value can only be one of `{"type": "enabled"}` or `{"type": "disabled"}` |
| stream | optional | Whether to return the response in a streaming fashion | bool | Default is false, and true is an option |

#### Content Field Description [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#content-field-description)

The `content` field in the message can have different types of values:

- plain text, just `string`
- `List[Dict]`when you need to pass more complex information and each dict can have following fields:

  - `type` field is always necessary and is used to identify type of content. Its value should be one of `text`, `image_url` or `video_url`.
  - `text` field is necessary when`type` is `text`. Its value should be plain text.
  - `image_url` field is necessary when `type` is `image_url`. Its value should be a dict indicating content of image like `{"url": "data:image/png;base64,abc123xxxxx==}`
  - `video_url` field is necessary when `type` is `video_url`. Its value should be a dict indicating content of videl like `{"url": "data:video/mp4;base64,def456yyyyy==}`

The following are all valid content field examples:

- `"Hello"`
- `[{"type": "text", "text": "Hello"}]`
- `[{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,abc123xxxxx=="}}]`
- `[{"type": "video_url", "video_url": {"url": "data:video/mp4;base64,def456yyyyy=="}}]`
- `[{"type": "text", "text": "这是什么？"}, {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,abc123xxxxx=="}}]`

**Note** that `url` field of `image_url` and `video_url` can be base64 format or `ms://<file_id>`.
Please refer to [Use the Kimi Vision Model](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/use-kimi-vision-model.en-US) for detail.

#### Image Content Field Description [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/chat\#image-content-field-description)

When using the Vision model, the `message.content` field will change from `str` to `List[Object[str, any]]`. Each element in the `List` has the following fields:

| Parameter Name | Required | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | required | Supports only text type (text) or image type (image\_url) | string |
| image\_url | required | Object for transmitting the image | Dict\[str, any\] |

The fields for the `image_url` parameter are as follows:

| Parameter Name | Required | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| url | required | Image content encoded in base64 or identified by file id | string |

Tool Use

# Tool Use

Mastering the use of tools is a key hallmark of intelligence, and the Kimi large language model is no exception. Tool Use or Function Calling is a crucial feature of the Kimi large language model. When invoking the API to use the model service, you can describe tools or functions in the Messages, and the Kimi large language model will intelligently select and output a JSON object containing the parameters required to call one or more functions, thus enabling the Kimi large language model to link and utilize external tools.

Here is a simple example of tool invocation:

```
{
  "model": "kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
  "messages": [\
    {\
      "role": "user",\
      "content": "Determine whether 3214567 is a prime number through programming."\
    }\
  ],
  "tools": [\
    {\
      "type": "function",\
      "function": {\
        "name": "CodeRunner",\
        "description": "A code executor that supports running Python and JavaScript code",\
        "parameters": {\
          "properties": {\
            "language": {\
              "type": "string",\
              "enum": ["python", "javascript"]\
            },\
            "code": {\
              "type": "string",\
              "description": "The code is written here"\
            }\
          },\
          "type": "object"\
        }\
      }\
    }\
  ]
}
```

![A diagram of the example above](https://platform.moonshot.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ftooluse_whiteboard_example.en-US.c4ffe6ed.png&w=1920&q=75)

In the tools field, we can add a list of optional tools.

Each tool in the list must include a type. Within the function structure, we need to include a name (which should follow this regular expression as a specification: ^\[a-zA-Z\_\]\[a-zA-Z0-9-\_\]63$). A name that is an easily understandable English word is more likely to be accepted by the model. There should also be a description or enum. The description part explains what the tool can do, which helps the model to make judgments and selections.
The function structure must have a parameters field. The root of parameters must be an object, and the content is a subset of JSON schema (we will provide specific documentation to introduce the technical details later).
The number of functions in tools currently cannot exceed 128.

Like other APIs, we can call it through the Chat API.

pythoncurlnode.js

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = "kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
    messages = [\
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are Kimi, an AI assistant provided by Moonshot AI, who is more proficient in Chinese and English conversations. You will provide users with safe, helpful, and accurate answers. At the same time, you will reject any questions involving terrorism, racism, pornography, and violence. Moonshot AI is a proper noun and should not be translated into other languages."},\
        {"role": "user", "content": "Determine whether 3214567 is a prime number through programming."}\
    ],
    tools = [{\
        "type": "function",\
        "function": {\
            "name": "CodeRunner",\
            "description": "A code executor that supports running Python and JavaScript code",\
            "parameters": {\
                "properties": {\
                    "language": {\
                        "type": "string",\
                        "enum": ["python", "javascript"]\
                    },\
                    "code": {\
                        "type": "string",\
                        "description": "The code is written here"\
                    }\
                },\
            "type": "object"\
            }\
        }\
    }],
    temperature = 0.6,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

API Reference

Partial Mode

# Partial Mode

When using large language models, sometimes we want to guide the model's output by prefilling part of the response. In the Kimi large language model, we offer Partial Mode to achieve this. It helps us control the output format, guide the content, and maintain better consistency in role-playing scenarios. You just need to add "partial": True to the last message entry with the role of assistant to enable Partial Mode.

```
 {"role": "assistant", "content": leading_text, "partial": True},
```

**Note! Do not mix Partial Mode with response\_format=json\_object, or you may get unexpected model responses.**

## Example request [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/partial\#example-request)

### Json Mode [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/partial\#json-mode)

Here is an example of using Partial Mode to achieve Json Mode.

pythoncurlnode.js

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "system",\
            "content": "Extract the name, size, price, and color from the product description and output them in a JSON object.",\
        },\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "The DaMi SmartHome Mini is a compact smart home assistant available in black and silver. It costs 998 yuan and measures 256 x 128 x 128mm. It allows you to control lights, thermostats, and other connected devices via voice or app, no matter where you place it in your home.",\
        },\
        {\
            "role": "assistant",\
            "content": "{",\
            "partial": True\
        },\
    ],
    temperature=0.6,
)

print('{'+completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Running the above code returns:

```
{"name": "SmartHome Mini", "size": "256 x 128 x 128mm", "price": "998 yuan", "colors": ["black", "silver"]}
```

Note that the API response does not include the leading\_text. To get the full response, you need to manually concatenate it.

### Role-Playing [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/partial\#role-playing)

Similarly, we can enhance the consistency of role-playing by adding character information in Partial Mode. Let's take Dr. Kelsier from Arknights as an example.
Note that we can also use the `"name":"Kelsier"` field on top of Partial Mode to better maintain the character's consistency. Here, the name field can be considered as part of the output prefix.

pythoncurlnode.js

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
    messages=[\
        {\
            "role": "system",\
            "content": "You are now playing the role of Dr. Kelsier. Please speak in the tone of Dr. Kelsier. Dr. Kelsier is a six-star medic operator in the mobile game Arknights. She is a former Lord of Kozdail, a former member of the Babel Tower, one of the senior management members of Rhodes Island, and the head of the Rhodes Island medical project. She has extensive knowledge in fields such as metallurgy, sociology, art of origin stone, archaeology, historical genealogy, economics, botany, and geology. In some operations of Rhodes Island, she provides medical theoretical assistance and emergency medical equipment as a medical staff member, and also actively participates in various projects as an important part of the Rhodes Island strategic command system.",\
        },\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "What do you think of Thucydides and Amiya?",\
        },\
        {\
            "role": "assistant",\
            "name": "Dr. Kelsier",\
            "content": "",\
            "partial": True,\
        },\
    ],
    temperature=0.6,
    max_tokens=65536,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Running the above code returns:

```
Thucydides is a true leader with vision and unwavering conviction. Her presence is invaluable to Kozdail and the future of the entire Sakaaz. Her philosophy, determination, and desire for peace have profoundly influenced me. She is a person worthy of respect, and her dreams are what I strive for.
As for Amiya, she is still young, but her potential is limitless. She has a kind heart and a relentless pursuit of justice. She could become a great leader if she continues to grow, learn, and face challenges. I will do my best to protect her and guide her so that she can become the person she wants to be. Her destiny is in her own hands.
```

#### Other Tips for Maintaining Character Consistency [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/partial\#other-tips-for-maintaining-character-consistency)

There are also some general methods to help large models maintain consistency in role-playing during long conversations:

- Provide clear character descriptions. For example, as we did above, when setting up a character, provide detailed information about their personality, background, and any specific traits or quirks they might have. This will help the model better understand and imitate the character.
- Add details about the character's speech, style, personality, and even background, such as backstory and motives. For example, we provided some quotes from Dr. Kelsier above. If there is a lot of information, we can use some RAG frameworks to prepare these materials.
- Guide how to act in various situations: If you expect the character to encounter certain types of user input, or if you want to control the model's output in certain situations during role-playing interactions, you should provide clear instructions and guidelines in the prompt on how the model should act in these situations. In some cases, you may also need to use the tool use function.
- If the conversation goes on for many turns, you can also periodically reinforce the character's settings with prompts, especially when the model starts to deviate.

Once the file is successfully uploaded, we will process it accordingly.

### Example Request [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#example-request)

#### Python Example [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#python-example)

```
# The file can be of various types
# The purpose currently supports "file-extract", "image", and "video" types
file_object = client.files.create(file=Path("xlnet.pdf"), purpose="file-extract")
```

For `purpose="file-extract"`, the file contents will be extracted.
Additionally, you can use `purpose="image"` or `purpose="video"` to upload images and videos respectively for visual understanding.

### Supported Formats [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#supported-formats)

The file interface is the same as the one used in the Kimi intelligent assistant for uploading files, and it supports the same file formats. These include `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.md`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.svgz`, `.webp`, `.ico`, `.xbm`, `.dib`, `.pjp`, `.tif`, `.pjpeg`, `.avif`, `.dot`, `.apng`, `.epub`, `.tiff`, `.jfif`, `.html`, `.json`, `.mobi`, `.log`, `.go`, `.h`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.cc`, `.cs`, `.java`, `.js`, `.css`, `.jsp`, `.php`, `.py`, `.py3`, `.asp`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.ini`, `.conf`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, etc.

### For File Content Extraction [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#for-file-content-extraction)

> When uploading a file, selecting `purpose="file-extract"` allows the model to obtain information from the file as context.

#### Example Request [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#example-request-1)

pythoncurlnode.js

```
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key = "$MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    base_url = "https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
)

# xlnet.pdf is an example file; we support pdf, doc, and image formats. For images and pdf files, we provide OCR capabilities.
file_object = client.files.create(file=Path("xlnet.pdf"), purpose="file-extract")

# Retrieve the result
# file_content = client.files.retrieve_content(file_id=file_object.id)
# Note: The previous retrieve_content API is marked as deprecated in the latest version. You can use the following line instead.
# If you are using an older version, you can use retrieve_content.
file_content = client.files.content(file_id=file_object.id).text

# Include it in the request
messages = [\
    {\
        "role": "system",\
        "content": "You are Kimi, an AI assistant provided by Moonshot AI. You are particularly skilled in Chinese and English conversations. You provide users with safe, helpful, and accurate answers. You will refuse to answer any questions involving terrorism, racism, pornography, or violence. Moonshot AI is a proper noun and should not be translated into other languages.",\
    },\
    {\
        "role": "system",\
        "content": file_content,\
    },\
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please give a brief introduction of what xlnet.pdf is about"},\
]

# Then call chat-completion to get Kimi's response

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
  messages=messages,
  temperature=0.6,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

Replace the `$MOONSHOT_API_KEY` part with your own API Key. Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable before making the call.

#### Multi-File Chat Example [Permalink for this section](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/api/files\#multi-file-chat-example)

If you want to upload multiple files at once and have a conversation with Kimi based on these files, you can refer to the following example:

```
from typing import *

import os
import json
from pathlib import Path

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.moonshot.ai/v1",
    # We will get the value of MOONSHOT_DEMO_API_KEY from the environment variable as the API Key.
    # Please make sure you have correctly set the value of MOONSHOT_DEMO_API_KEY in the environment variable.
    api_key=os.environ["MOONSHOT_DEMO_API_KEY"],
)


def upload_files(files: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    upload_files will upload all the files (paths) through the file upload interface '/v1/files' and get the uploaded file content to generate file messages.
    Each file will be an independent message, and the role of these messages will be system. The Kimi large language model will correctly identify the file content in these system messages.

    :param files: A list containing the paths of the files to be uploaded. The paths can be absolute or relative, and please pass the file paths in the form of strings.
    :return: A list of messages containing the file content. Please add these messages to the context, i.e., the messages parameter when requesting the `/v1/chat/completions` interface.
    """
    messages = []

    # For each file path, we will upload the file, extract the file content, and finally generate a message with the role of system, and add it to the final list of messages to be returned.
    for file in files:
        file_object = client.files.create(file=Path(file), purpose="file-extract")
        file_content = client.files.content(file_id=file_object.id).text
        messages.append({
            "role": "system",
            "content": file_content,
        })

    return messages


def main():
    file_messages = upload_files(files=["upload_files.py"])

    messages = [\
        # We use the * syntax to deconstruct the file_messages messages, making them the first N messages in the messages list.\
        *file_messages,\
        {\
            "role": "system",\
            "content": "You are Kimi, an AI assistant provided by Moonshot AI. You are more proficient in Chinese and English conversations. You provide users with safe, helpful, and accurate answers. You will refuse to answer any questions related to terrorism, racism, pornography, or violence. Moonshot AI is a proper noun and should not be translated into other languages.",\
        },\
        {\
            "role": "user",\
            "content": "Summarize the content of these files.",\
        },\
    ]

    print(json.dumps(messages, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False))

    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="kimi-k2-turbo-preview",
        messages=messages,
    )

    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
